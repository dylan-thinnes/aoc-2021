Advent of Code, 2021

These are my advent of code solutions.
In the same way as [last year](https://github.com/dylan-thinnes/aoc-2020), I do every day in a different language.

## Summary

Languages and solutions so far can be got by running `./summarize`.

```
        |1|2|
awk     | |█|
haskell | |█|
j       |░| |
nix     |█| |
perl    | |█|
```

Light/medium fill means solution 1 only or solution 2 only.
